## Summary

Create a Grant Program for the Taraxa ecosystem to incentivize developer engagement and allocate 10 million USD worth of TARA coins to the Grant Program from the Community & Ecosystem Fund. 
<br><br><br>

## Motivation

A Taraxa Grant Program can help grow the Taraxa ecosystem by attracting and incentivizing developers to build on the Taraxa network. This Grant Program can also be an excellent way for Taraxa to stay competitive in the market, as grants are routinely offered to developers by most Layer-1's in the wider crypto ecosystem.
<br><br><br>

## Specifications

### Grant Program Fund Size

The Taraxa Grant Program's funds will consist of 10 million USD worth of TARA coins. 
<br><br>

### Source of Grant Program Funds 

The Taraxa Grant Program's funds will be drawn from the overall Community & Ecosystem Fund. You can see a breakdown of the allocations on the [Taraxa Token Information](https://token.taraxa.io/) page. 
<br><br>

### Application Process

Any individual, team, and organizations of any type are welcome to apply to the Taraxa Grant Program. The initial application into the Taraxa Grant Program will require the following details,

- Core team members' profiles
- Every team member's Taraxa Community Site account with successfully passed KYC
- Working prototype and open-sourced Github repositories
- Any existing traction in other ecosystems
- Benefits your project will bring to the Taraxa ecosystem and its community
- Technical roadmap
- Go to market roadmap
- Measurable milestones tied to use of funds used for grant disbursements
<br><br>

### Review Process

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis by members of [Taraxa's core development team](https://www.taraxa.io/team). The dev team may reach out to applicants to request additional information and/or schedule calls as necessary. 

Applicants will be notified of decisions via email.
<br><br>

### Evaluation Criteria

Taraxa Grant Program is meant to fund projects that are, 

- Decentralized: only truly permissionless and decentralized projects will be considered. 
- Open-source: only projects founded on the idea of open collaboration and innovation will be considered.
- Uniquely contributes to Taraxa’s ecosystem: projects that add unique value to the Taraxa ecosystem will be prioritized. This can be a truly unique piece of technology or application, or it could simply be something that Taraxa’s ecosystem sorely lacks but already exists elsewhere.
- Clear use of funds: thoughtful, practical, and truthful explanation of how funds will be used to accomplish measurable milestones. 
- Ability to execute: convince us that you have what it takes to not just execute but also persist till your vision comes to fruition. 

Taraxa Grant Program is NOT meant to be used for, 

- Marketing: to ensure regulatory compliance, grants will only be given to fund technical development, not marketing.
- Substitute for venture funding: to ensure that ecosystem projects simultaneously can stand on their own with sufficient market and user validation, as well as minimizing the long-term undue influence of the Taraxa Grant Program on any ecosystem project, ensuring their independence. 
<br><br>

### Grant Size

Grant sizes will be variably adjusted according to each applicant's project nature and needs. 
<br><br>

### Grant Disbursement Process

Grants are disbursed according to the achievement of measurable milestones tied to use of funds as agreed upon between the applicant and the dev team conducting reviews. The Taraxa dev team will be available to meet with grant recipients on a regular basis, not only to receive updates on projects but also to see what help beyond the funds the dev team can help to provide.
<br><br>

### Follow-Up Grants 

Beyond the initial grant, depending on the dev team's appraisal, there could be larger follow-up grants. However, to receive larger follow-up grants, the project in question will need to receive some degree of support from the Taraxa community in the form of a governance vote. The exact threshold of the support (e.g., number of votes, number of unique voters) will again vary depending on the project. 
<br><br><br>

## Rationale

The following are a set of brief explanations of why the [Specifications](#specifications) are written as is. Overall the Specifications adhere to high-level principles to allow flexibility in execution in crypto's fast & dynamic environment. 
<br><br><br>

The total Taraxa Grant Program size is meant to be competitive (big enough) in the market, yet reachable (small enough) that it's within the affordability of the Community & Ecosystem funds. 
<br><br>

Since the Community & Ecosystem funds were specifically set aside to help drive adoption, it the natural source of funds for the Grant Program. 
<br><br>

The application process is pretty standard, including KYC, which is included for compliance reasons. 
<br><br>

Since every project is going to be quite different, it only makes sense that they're evaluated on an individualized basis. The core dev team is a natural choice to conduct the evaluations for the first round of the grants, since they possess the technical know-how to not only conduct the evaluations but also to offer assistance should it become necessary. 
<br><br>

While each applicant to the Taraxa Grant Program is evaluated on their individualized merits, there should be a set of high-level guidelines, which is why the Evaluation Criteria exist. 
<br><br>

Grant sizes are variable but for the first round an internal cap should exist but remain undisclosed within the development team. Grant sizes are variable due to the aforementioned individualized nature of each applicant project. There needs to be a cap for the first round of grants simply because the Taraxa Grant Program is meant to incentivize and fund a large number and variety of projects to ensure the diversity of the ecosystem and to systematically minimize the risk of any given project failing. The reason such caps should not be disclosed is that, once a cap is disclosed, every single project will request the cap, adversely incentivizing inaccurate representations of their true use of funds. 
<br><br>

Grants are never to be given out in one lump sum, as lump-sum disbursement highly incentivizes bounty hunters who have no interest in actually building and maintaining a sustainable project in the Taraxa ecosystem. Grants disbursed according to quantifiable milestones is fair and holds all parties accountable, positively incentivizing sustainable & long-term development as well as maintenance of high quality projects. 
<br><br>

Certain projects may show significant promise but require follow-up grants to help further their development. Since more grants are given over longer periods of time, the hurdle for a project to receive a follow-up grant needs to be higher, specifically it needs to demonstrate that it has significant support from the Taraxa community, quantified in the form of a governance vote. The exact voting result hurdle for each project may be again different, but needs to take into account not just the total # of votes, but also the amount of unique wallets and potentially the wallets' age. These considerations are designed to encourage projects to actually build something that the community likes and wants and to be responsive to community feedback.
