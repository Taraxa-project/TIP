## Summary

Create a Grant Program for the Taraxa ecosystem to incentivize developer engagement and allocate 10 million USD worth of TARA coins to the Grant Program from the Community & Ecosystem Fund. 
<br><br><br>

## Motivation

A Taraxa Grant Program can help grow the Taraxa ecosystem by attracting and incentivizing developers to build on the Taraxa network. This Grant Program can also be an excellent way for Taraxa to stay competitive in the market, as grants are routinely offered to developers by most Layer-1's in the wider crypto ecosystem.
