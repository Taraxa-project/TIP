## Summary

Create a Grant Program for the Taraxa ecosystem to incentivize developer engagement and allocate 10 million USD worth of TARA coins to the Grant Program from the Community & Ecosystem Fund. 
<br><br><br>

## Motivation

A Taraxa Grant Program can help grow the Taraxa ecosystem by attracting and incentivizing developers to build on the Taraxa network. This Grant Program can also be an excellent way for Taraxa to stay competitive in the market, as grants are routinely offered to developers by most Layer-1's in the wider crypto ecosystem.
<br><br><br>

## Specifications

### Grant Program Fund Size

The Taraxa Grant Program's funds will consist of 10 million USD worth of TARA coins. 
<br><br>

<br><br>

### Evaluation Criteria

- Decentralized: only truly permissionless and decentralized projects will be considered. 
- Open-source: only projects founded on the idea of open collaboration and innovation will be considered.
- Uniquely contributes to Taraxa’s ecosystem: projects that add unique value to the Taraxa ecosystem will be prioritized. This can be a truly unique piece of technology or application, or it could simply be something that Taraxa’s ecosystem sorely lacks but already exists elsewhere.
- Clear use of funds: thoughtful, practical, and truthful explanation of how funds will be used to accomplish measureable milestones. 
- Ability to execute: convince us that you have what it takes to not just execute but also persist till your vision comes to fruition.

- Marketing: to ensure regulatory compliance, grants will only be given to fund technical development, not marketing.

### Grant Size

Grant sizes will be variably adjusted according to each applicant's project nature and needs. 
<br><br>

### Grant Disbursement Process

Grants are disbursed according to the achievewment of measureable milestones tied to use of funds as agreed upon between the applicant and the dev team conducting reviews. The Taraxa dev team will be available to meet with grant recipients on a regular basis, not only to receive updates on projects but also to see what help beyond the funds the dev team can help to provide.
